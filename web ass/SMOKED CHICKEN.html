Smoking involves slow cooking the chicken at a lower temperature, <br>often over indirect heat generated by wood chips or pellets.<br> This slow cooking process certainly takes longer, <br>but it also allows the smoky flavor to penetrate the meat,<br> leaving you with tender, flavorful chicken.

     *1 tablespoon salt<br>

     *1 tablespoon dark brown sugar<br>

<h2 style="Color:white">RECIPE:</h2>
1)Gather the ingredients. <br>
2)Stir together the salt, sugar, pepper, paprika, thyme, and garlic. <br>Rub the chicken inside and out, and under the skin of the breast and thighs with the spice mixture. <br>
3)Prepare the smoker with fruitwood chips.<br> Smoke the chicken at 250 F/120 C until the thermometer inserted into <br>the center of the chicken breast reaches 160 F.<br> This will take about 3 hoursâ€”or 45 minutes per pound. <br>
4)Once cooked, remove from heat and tent with aluminum foil.<br>
5)Let chicken rest for 20 minutes.<br>
6)Carve chicken and serve with your favorite sides. Enjoy!<br>
