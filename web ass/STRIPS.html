1)Preheat oven to 180C / 160C Fan / GM4 and grease a baking tray with spray oil<br>

3)Place the crushed crisps into a bowl and add the cornflour, mixing it in well. <br>At this point you can also add some black pepper if you wish to.<br>
4)In another bowl, beat the egg.<br>
5)Cut each of the chicken breasts into 3 long fillets.<br>
