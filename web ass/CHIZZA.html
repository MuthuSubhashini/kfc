<h2>RECIPE:</h2><br>
1)Slice the chicken breast horizontally and shape in butterfly chicken.slightly flatten them.<br>

3)Take the marinated chicken and coat in the breading flour(all purpose flour+cornstarch+salt + pepper)<br>
4)Again coat the floured chicken in egg. Now coat the egg washed chicken in crushed cornflakes and keep aside for 20 mins.<br>
5)Deep fry in oil and drain.(do not drain on paper towels as this makes deep fried soggy.Instead use wire rack set)<br>
6)Apply pizza sauce on fried chicken and top it with mozarella cheese + oregano+ chilli flakes(use anything as per your preference). Bake and grill on preheated oven for 8- 10 mins till cheese melts.<br>
